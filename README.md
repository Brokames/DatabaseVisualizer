# Database Viewer (working title)

## Getting Started

TODO Need a better explanation here.
```shell
pip install https://github.com/Brokames/ParquetVisualizer.git
```

## Contributing

This project uses [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) for package
management and [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to enforce linting
requirements. Follow the steps below to get setup using both tools.

### Environment Setup

```shell
# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
$ pipenv install --dev

# Initialize git hooks
$ pre-commit install

# Activate the virtual environment
$ pipenv shell
```

With the environment activated you can start coding! When you are done you can
deactivate the environment by simply running `exit`.

### Development Installation

With the virtual environment active, use the following command to run `dbv`.
Note: your current directory must be the project root.

```shell
$ python -m dbv.cli
```

Alternatively, you can install it in the virtual environement with:

```shell
$ pip install .
```

### flake8: general style rules

Our first and probably most important tool is flake8. It will run a set of plugins on your codebase and warn you about any non-conforming lines.
Here is a sample output:
```
~> flake8
./app.py:1:1: D100 Missing docstring in public module
./app.py:1:6: N802 function name 'helloWorld' should be lowercase
./app.py:1:16: E201 whitespace after '('
./app.py:1:17: ANN001 Missing type annotation for function argument 'name'
./app.py:1:23: ANN201 Missing return type annotation for public function
./app.py:2:1: D400 First line should end with a period
./app.py:2:1: D403 First word of the first line should be properly capitalized
./app.py:3:19: E225 missing whitespace around operator
```

Each line corresponds to an error. The first part is the file path, then the line number, and the column index.
Then comes the error code, a unique identifier of the error, and then a human-readable message.

If, for any reason, you do not wish to comply with this specific error on a specific line, you can add `# noqa: CODE` at the end of the line.
For example:
```python
def helloWorld():  # noqa: N802
    ...
```
will pass linting. Although we do not recommend ignoring errors unless you have a good reason to do so.

It is run by calling `flake8` in the project root.

#### Plugin List:

- `flake8-annotations`: Checks your code for the presence of [type-hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html).
- `flake8-bandit`: Checks for common security breaches.
- `flake8-docstring`: Checks that you properly documented your code.
- `flake8-isort`: Makes sure you ran ISort on the project.

### ISort: automatic import sorting

This second tool will sort your imports according to the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports). That's it! One less thing for you to do!

It is run by calling `isort .` in the project root. Notice the dot at the end, it tells ISort to use the current directory.

### Pre-commit: run linting before committing

This third tool doesn't check your code, but rather makes sure that you actually *do* check it.

It makes use of a feature called [Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) which allow you to run a piece of code before running `git commit`.
The good thing about it is that it will cancel your commit if the lint doesn't pass. You won't have to wait for Github Actions to report and have a second fix commit.

It is *installed* by running `pre-commit install` and can be run manually by calling only `pre-commit`.

[Lint before you push!](https://soundcloud.com/lemonsaurusrex/lint-before-you-push)

#### Hooks List:

- `check-toml`: Lints and corrects your TOML files.
- `check-yaml`: Lints and corrects your YAML files.
- `end-of-file-fixer`: Makes sure you always have an empty line at the end of your file.
- `trailing-whitespaces`: Removes whitespaces at the end of each line.
- `python-check-blanket-noqa`: Forbids you from using noqas on large pieces of code.
- `isort`: Runs ISort.
- `flake8`: Runs flake8.
